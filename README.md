## Domain of interest
### Ukraine War
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?\
We are interested in this field because we want to see the war through the eyes of statistics. Apart from acquiring informaiton from the news media and other
text-based contents, we try to collect some data and bring a data-driven persepective to the audiences. The cause of a war is complicated and the impacts on 
both countries is significant and extensive. To have a deeper understanding of the war, we plan to interpret the war with the dataset on the internet.

- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

1. The first data driven project I found was the analysis and summary about the exchange rate of Russian Ruble to the other major currencies.
The research utilized data since 25 years ago to make a line graph demonstrating the fluctuation of the Russian Ruble. It also included forecast for the next 
year and a table comparing the daily change of Ruble's exchange rate with different currencies.\
